# Expense App

## About

This Expense flutter app allows the user to document past expenses, and visualize the past 7
from a bar chart. 

This app was created early on in my journey to learn dart/flutter.
It was created with the intent to get familiar with passing data from widget to widget, along with using callback functions.

We also explored the use of MediaQueries and constraints.
